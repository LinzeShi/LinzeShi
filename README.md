👋 Hi there, I’m @LinzeShi

👀 I'm deeply passionate about technology and innovation, especially in the realms of distributed systems, backend development, and cloud computing. My journey in tech began at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I earned my degree in Automation Engineering, and it has taken me to exciting roles at leading tech companies like Microsoft and ByteDance.

🌱 I’m currently a Master of Science in Information Networking student at Carnegie Mellon University, honing my skills in advanced cloud architectures and exploring cutting-edge AI technologies. My academic and professional pursuits are driven by a commitment to understanding and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology, particularly those that aim to improve the scalability and efficiency of cloud services or integrate AI in innovative ways. I thrive in environments where creativity and collaboration intersect to create impactful technological solutions.

📫 Feel free to connect with me! You can reach me via email at linzeshi0@gmail.com or through my LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/linze-shi/]. I'm always open to discussing tech trends, project ideas, or potential collaborations.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or buried in tech articles, you might find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes or blogging about my latest culinary discoveries. I believe that cooking and coding are similar in that they both require a blend of creativity and precision to create something wonderful.
